# NonlinearSequencer
Max package of NLS
Ideally you should read the paper first, it's not too long and it will make everything clearer. Use the Example Navigator to understand NLS step by step. I have added a new set of objects not directly mentioned in the paper: nls.cross_seq2~ and  nls.cross_seq3~. They generate triggers based on LFO crossings.
Still to be developed is what I cal the Sequencer Distortion component of NLS.
