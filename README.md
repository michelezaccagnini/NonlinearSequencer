# NonlinearSequencer
## Max package of NLS
The general concept of NLS is explained in detail in the [Nonlinear Sequencing paper](https://github.com/michelezaccagnini/NonlinearSequencer/blob/main/Nonlinear_SequencingAM20.pdf). To the tools described in the paper -nls.fluctuate_phasor~ and nls.distorted_phasor~ (the latter not yet implemented) I added another two core modules: nls.cross_seq2~ nad, nls.cross_seq3~. Cross sequencers generate triggers based on the intersection of 2 or 3 LFOs of varying frequency, amplitude and waveform. Aside from core modules the package includes ancillary modules to facilitate the use of NLS. 
Use the Example Navigator to understand NLS step by step.
